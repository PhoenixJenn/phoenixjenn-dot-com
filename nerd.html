                  <p><h3 style="margin-top:0px;"><b>I took a very windy path to get to where I am today.</b></h3></p>
                  <p>My first job was in graphic design at Ernst &amp; Young, LLC in the Healthcare Consulting division.
                    It was a temp job during my senior year at BC and they offered me significantly more money
                    than any of the sales or marketing jobs for which I was interviewing on campus.
                    I remember one of the partners asked me what I wanted to do with my career now that I had a degree. My response was that I wanted
                    to become a Director of Technology one day. I told him my strategy &#8212; to work in all of the
                    functional departments that I would manage (help desk, networking, software, etc), thereby being able to completely understand the pains of my organization,
                    from the ground up. He told me I was crazy and walked away. What he didn't know is that I would follow through with
                    my plan and one day build a product that would eventually sell to a fortune 500 company
                    (press release <i> <a href="https://www.factset.com/news/streetaccount" target="_blank" style="color:#fcfcfc;">here</a>). My title was Director of Technology
                    before it sold.
                  </p>
                   <p>The problem with realizing your dreams is that you're left with the feeling "Ok, I did that. What's next?"
                      The problem was that I didn't have a plan. Desperate to fill that empty void of having a life goal, I started
                      teaching fitness classes, became a personal trainer, got a masters degree in sport psychology and opened a gym.
                      Once again, I felt "Now what?".
                      </p>
                       <p>In late 2016 I made a resolution, that I would return my passion to technology.
                        My goals included:
