ask, just ask</span></h2>
<p>Many communication channels at Amazon, including but not limited to emai=
l, Slack channels, and Sage are designed for asynchronous communication, me=
aning that you and other members of the discussion are not all online and s=
peaking in real-time. If you have a question and are using an asynchronous =
channel, ask it in your original post. This will help people get you answer=
s faster because they don't have to be online and focusing on the conversat=
ion at the same time as you.</p>
<p>Examples of how<span>&nbsp;</span><em>not</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to ask =
questions in asynchronous channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Hi"</li>
<li>"I have a question with X technology."</li>
<li>"Does anyone here have experience with Y?"</li>
</ul>
<p>Rephrasing questions to support asynchronous responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Hey community. I'm working with X and trying to do Y, but am receiving=
 Z. I have tried A and my environment is B. Does anyone have an idea as to =
what is going on?"</li>
<li>"Hi folks. I am getting started with X. Does anyone have some resources=
 I can review?"</li>
<li>"Howdy people. I am trying to do Y and am looking into X. Does anyone h=
ave any impressions of using it?"</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to speak with someone live, you can ask if anyone has time t=
o speak with you live to discuss your question. However, it's less likely t=
hat you and a stranger on another team are going to be able to speak live o=
n a topic at the same time than someone being able to respond asynchronousl=
y.</p>

<p>When you have a problem with a piece of a large program, it's often very=
 useful to try to extract the failing portion of the code into a standalone=
 example. This has multiple significant benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The process of narrowing down exactly where the problem is happening ca=
n often enable you to solve the problem yourself.</li>
<li>It ensures that other people can reproduce the problem</li>
<li>You can probably use the self-contained portion as a test case to preve=
nt regressions in the future.</li>

<p>When you ask "how do I do X", please also describe "why I want to do X".=
 That's because, while you might have arrived at "X" as the way to solve a =

verall problem that doesn't involve doing "X" at all.</p>

<p><span class=3D"mw-headline"><span style=3D"color: rgb(51,51,51);">If you=

<h2 id=3D"HowtobeanAwesomeColleague-Choosetherightaudienceandvenue"><span c=
lass=3D"mw-headline">Choose the right audience and venue</span></h2>
<p>If your question is about publicly-available software or services, such =
as widely-used open source software, the best place to ask your question is=
 probably in open public forums, rather than on Amazon-internal channels.</=
p>
<p>If you have a problem with a particular system or component, check its d=
ocumentation for contact and support information. The documentation may rec=
ommend using Sage, using a mailing list, or opening a SIM issue with the ow=
ners.</p>
<p>Sage is designed from the ground up to be searchable. If someone has ask=
ed the question already, there is a good chance that you can find the answe=
r there. If you are the first person to ask your question, then Sage will m=
ake your question and its answers available to other people searching later=
. Make sure you use relevant tags when searching and when asking your quest=
ion.</p>
<p>Mailing lists are searchable if they are set up to be archived. You can =
find their old messages on the<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=3D"external-link"=
 href=3D"https://is.amazon.com/" style=3D"text-decoration: none;" rel=3D"no=
follow">Internal Search page</a>. (Select "Email List Archive" as the sourc=
e.) Like Sage tags, the people reading the questions are likely to be famil=
iar with the topic.</p>
<p>When looking for relevant mailing lists in the email list tool, be sure =
to check to see if an info message or description has been set for a list b=
efore mailing it. Don't assume that the mailing list is relevant based on t=
he name alone--name conflicts are common at Amazon. (If you own a list that=
 gets off-topic messages,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=3D"https://w.amazon.com=

<p>Don't email unrelated lists just because they have a large audience. If =

at can answer your question or point you in the right direction. Just becau=
se the majority of code written at Amazon is in Java doesn't mean that all =
questions should go to java-dev@!</p>
<p>In some cases you may have the opportunity to choose between multiple on=
-topic forums, for example, Sage, an email list, and the support queue of a=
 team that owns a product that you're using. For general guidance or troubl=
eshooting, you may want to turn to the community-supported forums first (as=
 the owners should also monitor those) to get a wider audience. If you do a=
sk a question in multiple places, please mention where it is cross-posted s=
o that multiple people don't spend time answering your question in differen=
t places. If you get an answer in one place, please update all of the other=
 places you asked the question.</p>

<p><strong>Make (Hybrid) Meetings Inclusive</strong></p>
<p>As our way of working continues to evolve, we recognize that many meetin=
gs will include a meaningful split of its participants between hub and home=
, across various locations. With that comes some work for each of us as mee=
ting facilitators (and participants) to ensure all voices are heard regardl=
ess of location.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-office meetings and remote participants:</strong> When a num=
ber of employees are in the same conference room, it=E2=80=99s easy for fol=
ks to fall into conversations with each other, which can be challenging for=
 remote folks to participate in and/or read the room. <u>Mechanism(s):</u> =
If a meeting has remote participants, folks in office should enable their c=
amera just as they would from home to make it easier for the remote folks t=
o read body language etc. Folks in the office should also keep an eye on CH=
IME comments etc. As a tenet, in-office participation should not be at the =
expense of remote employees.</li>
<li><strong>When and how to jump in</strong>:<strong> </strong>absent high-=
fidelity body language and other contextual signals, its challenging to par=
ticipate in meetings without interrupting someone, or being interrupted. <u=
>Mechanism(s):</u> If there=E2=80=99s a natural break, feel free to make yo=
ur comment. If it=E2=80=99s more of an active conversation, then please use=
 the =E2=80=9Craise your hand=E2=80=9D feature in CHIME. As the document ow=
ner and/or meeting leader need to keep us on track, its ok for them to spea=
k without hand-raising on every intermission.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for other=E2=80=99s opinions first: </strong>we all need to=
 take our turn to participate, but when we have more junior folks in the ro=
om please give them the chance to speak or provide input first. This is rea=
lly important to help folks stretch their wings as they develop in their ca=
reers. Please also take care that we don=E2=80=99t squelch feedback, and fi=
rst seek to understand feedback before giving an opinion on it. <u>Mechanis=
m(s):</u> More senior leaders should let other folks give their opinion pri=
or to sharing their own, to learn what others think. Where we can, meeting =
owners should use round-robin and other mechanisms to open up feedback from=
 all participants.</li>
<li><strong>Create an opening for others:</strong> meetings should be balan=
ced and not dominated by any individual(s). We should open the floor to bro=
ader participation by giving space and time for this. We need to solicit mo=
re voice, and seek diverse perspectives. <u>Mechanism(s):</u> If you are mo=
derating the meeting, and observe someone dominating a conversation to the =
point that others can=E2=80=99t contribute, then redirect the conversation =
to other participants. When participating, consider the perspective from th=
e other folks in the room.</li>
<li><strong>Help others: </strong>we all need friendly feedback on how we=
=E2=80=99re doing<strong> </strong>to make durable change. <u>Mechanism(s)<=
/u>: If you see someone demonstrating best meeting practices, then recogniz=
e and reinforce them. And if you observe someone who is not following the g=
uidelines, then bring this up to them in an appropriate setting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some quick tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you=E2=80=99re in the hub, join the meeting on your laptop and selec=
t the option to =E2=80=9CDisable Mic &amp; Speakers=E2=80=9D to avoid feedb=
ack, and share your video.</li>
<li>Have everyone in the meeting, regardless of whether they are in the hub=
 or remote, use the hand raise feature.</li>
<li>For larger meetings, assign the role of =E2=80=9CChime chat moderator=
=E2=80=9D to manage attendee list, field comments/questions, and yield the =
floor to those participants using the =E2=80=9Craised hand=E2=80=9D feature=
.</li>
<li>Encourage remote participants off-camera to join with video when speaki=
ng.</li>

<p>Help meetings become more inclusive by appointing a new team member as t=

<p>A facilitator is responsible for leading and guiding the conversation, e=

<p>Sharing the main agenda items in advance gives everyone the chance to pr=

<p>Despite the hard work being done around DEI, privilege and power dynamic=

>INFO:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the subject</li>
<li>For emails with a question, I'll include<span>&nbsp;</span><em>QUESTION=
:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the subject</li>
<li>I'll ensure that the subject clearly represents the purpose/topic of th=
e email as appropriate including a Customer Name / Initiative Name</li>
</ol></li>
<li>I'll use<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>TO</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><stro=
ng>CC&nbsp;</strong>and<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>BCC&nbsp;</strong>appropr=
iately
<ol>
<li><strong>TO&nbsp;</strong>for all those that I expect to<span>&nbsp;</sp=
an><strong>act on/depend on&nbsp;</strong>my message</li>
<li><strong>CC&nbsp;</strong>for all others that I want to keep<span>&nbsp;=
</span><em>in the loop</em>
<ul>
<li>When sending to large groups, I'll always lean towards CC'ing groups, I=
 may also send<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>TO&nbsp;</strong>people included i=
n a group if they match the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>TO&nbsp;</strong>rule=
 (don't worry they won't get it twice)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>BCC&nbsp;</strong>only when<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>I really&=
nbsp;</strong>have to ( it breaks our precious filters/rules :) )
<ul>
<li>As for any good rule, there are exceptions to this to reduce traffic ov=
erall by excluding groups from replies
<ul>
<li>BCC should only be used to prevent reply=E2=80=94all such as in a<span>=
&nbsp;</span><em>Please Welcome</em><span>&nbsp;</span>email, never to secr=
etly send someone an email. &nbsp;If you want someone to see what you sent =
without the recipient knowing, reforward your sent mail to them.</li>
<li>If you are BCC=E2=80=99ing legitimately, in the body of the email you s=
hould literally list who got the email (either people or groups.). This wil=
l prevent people forwarding with a<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Did you see this?<=
/em><span>&nbsp;</span>header or is a useful method of allowing people to s=
tep out of or hand over a conversation by being aware that the handover has=
 taken place, but excluding people from future responses.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>I'll not hijack threads or try and address multiple different topics in=
 a single email
<ol>
<li>Stay aligned with the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>SUBJECT</strong>
<ul>
<li>Do another email, that is OK (the receiver can react on a single ask, i=
f I link different deliverables, I'll likely just slow things down / hold u=
p a response)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>I'll not assume you<span>&nbsp;</span><em>have an action</em><span>&nbs=
p;</span>because I sent you an email, my inbox is not your to-do list and y=
our inbox is not mine</li>
<li>I'll take ownership to follow up when I receive an<span>&nbsp;</span><e=
m>Out of Office</em>, vacations should not come with a punishment of a big =
email backlog</li>
<li>Do I really need to send this email? Should this be a quick Chime or Sl=
ack message instead?</li>
<li>When I loop someone into a long email thread, I'll summarise why I loop=
ed them in and not expect them to unpack the whole thread. &nbsp;(Credit ed=
jacks@)
<ol>
<li>I'll also tidy it up some if required, remove those big old disclaimer =
signatures and make it more readable</li>
</ol></li>
<li>When someone starts a storm potentially by say sending "Unsubscribe" to=
 a huge list - just reply to them. NOT THE LIST.
<ol>
<li>Notable Storms have been caused by people asking other people not to re=
ply / to stop replying</li>
<li>Just let it go, delete it / even better "Ignore Conversation" if you ar=
