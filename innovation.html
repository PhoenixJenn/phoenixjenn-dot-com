                  <p>At Audible, I spent a few years leading technical innovation. In preparing for the role, I did a lot of research. 
                  Workshops, books, YouTube videos and interviews with folks who lead innovation. This page will provide an overview of the tools in my toolbox.

                    * A “first-principles mindset” involves breaking down complex problems into their most basic, foundational elements and building up from there to create original solutions. This method of thinking, encourages deep questioning and analysis to bypass assumptions and conventional wisdom. By reducing a problem to its essential principles, you can understand its core issues and explore innovative solutions that might not be apparent when thinking in terms of higher-level processes or inherited methods. This approach fosters creativity and often leads to transformative breakthroughs, as it pushes you to consider all possible alternatives and to invent new ways of doing things.

                    <b>Chapter 1: Flying in the Face of Uncertainty</b><br/>
                    Some things we know for certain, some things we don’t. There are known unknowns and unknown unknowns. Embracing uncertainty is often a 
                    necessity for making progress. In fact, it is in our level guide (Ambiguity)! Remember when Pluto was a planet? That was based on the facts that 
                    astronomers had at the time. Sometimes when you get more facts, the rules of the game change – and that’s ok! We have to be open to being able to 
                    pivot when the game changes.
                    </p>

                    <b>Thought Experiment:</b>
What is the worst-case scenario, given what I know now? How likely is this scenario? Or as I like to say “Tell me why this won’t work.”
What ways can you mitigate risk? (ie., adding redundancies or adding extra features/buffers for margins of error)
At Amazon, we talk about the difference between a One-way door and a Two-way door.

                     <b>Chapter 2:  Reasoning from First Principles </b><br/>
                     There are times when our assumptions will be challenged, and that is ok. Challenging assumptions is important to fight the battle of “We’ve always 
                    done it this way.” Always start with “Why are we doing this? What problem are we trying to solve? What are our goals?” Remember Occam’s Razor? 
                    When faced with two solutions that explan the data equally well, the simplest solution is often the correct one.
                    </p><p>
                    <b>Thought Experiment:</b>
What if we started from scratch, what would be do differently? What if we had no constraints?
If everyone does it this way, what if we did it this other way instead?
                     </p>

                     <b>Chapter 3: Mind at Play  </b><br/>
                     Thinking is the new scrolling. In order to make breakthroughs, we need to budget time to think. That means putting something on your calendar 
                    where you step away from the technology and sit with your thoughts. Get bored! It can be uncomfortable at first. Personally, I have two regular habits: 
                    (1) I either walk and listen to a book in the morning or I run/bike. I find when I am not intentionally thinking about work I get the best work ideas (2) I 
                    immediately sit down with my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4kueYhGEc8" target="_blank">Bullet Journal</a> (6:51) when I am done to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO7S3sCd8rw" target="_blank">log ideas</a>. 
</p><p>

                        In addition to giving your mind time to self-organize and then capturing your thoughts, it is important to make time toLearn and Be Curious. While 
                        curiosity killed Schrodinger’s cat, it is the key to unlocking new ideas. I’m sure you’ve heard and probably used the expression “Think outside the box”. 
                        There’s a great book called “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-New-Boxes-Paradigm-Creativity/dp/B00EA2I8Y4/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=" target="_blank">Thinking in New Boxes</a>”, 
                        which can be summarized as the following: Having multiple boxes allows you to draw 
                        connections that you may not have otherwise to solve problems in creative ways. 
                        <!-- In fact, it is in our People Principles as “Study and Draw Inspiration 
                        from Culture and Technology”. -->
</p><p>
                        Ozan talks about the “Myth of the Lone Genius” and how optimal creativity doesn’t happen in complete isolation. This is why it is important to take time 
                        with your team to talk about problems and discuss various solutions. While doing so, also remember that experts are not the only ones who bring forth 
                        great ideas. Sometimes a beginner’s mind will help with divergent thinking exercises
